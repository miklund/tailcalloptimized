![Being Geek by Michael Lopp](/assets/posts/2011-03-09-book-review-being-geek-by-michael-lopp/beinggeek.jpg)

_Michael Lopp, famous for the blog [Rands in Repose](http://randsinrepose.com/) has written a book with the title Being Geek - The Software Developer Career Handbook. I've read it through and found it easy to read, humorous and full of first hand knowledge about the software industry._

## Being Geek

Michael Lopp has written two excellent blog posts [the nerd handbook](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/2007/11/11/the_nerd_handbook.html) and [managing nerds](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2011/01/17/managing_nerds.html) that made me buy this book. Sadly, these two contributions to the book are the only one that is strictly about being a geek. The rest of the book is mostly about managing people, which is not very surprising as it seems Michael Lopp spent most of his career as a manager.  It's ok. It's just not what I expected from this book.

## The Software Developer Career Handbook

I will give it to the author, that he fulfills the subtitle of this book. First hand experience of how to become a great asset in a software company. How you should read other people around you, and how you should handle management. Yes, I knew all of this before I read the book, because I've read similar books in the same subject but it was great to get a more personal twitch on it, than most other books will give you.

## The good, the bad and the ugly

This is a fun and easy to read book. It is something for the hammock a warm summer day. It is not a book that you should base your daily decisions on, but some stories that you could bring along with you.  The ugly part of this book, is that you feel deceived by the title. I where expecting more anecdotes about geeks and being geek.
