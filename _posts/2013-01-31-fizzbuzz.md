<p>I've always found the FizzBuzz problem to be quite uninteresting, but I guess that it is quite good to rule out candidates in an early stage. You quickly notice if they can express themselves in code or not.</p>
<p>The problem is simple. Write out the number 1 .. 100 and switch out each number divisible by 3 with "fizz" and every number divisible by 5 with "buzz. Any number divisible with both 3 and 5 should be replace by "fizz buzz".</p>
<p>Here's a trivial solution in F#. Enjoy.</p>
<pre class="brush:fsharp">// System.String.Join(" ", fizzbuzz 1 |> Seq.take 100)
let rec fizzbuzz x = seq {
        yield
            match x % 3, x % 5 with
            | 0, 0 -> "fizz buzz"
            | 0, _ -> "fizz"
            | _, 0 -> "buzz"
            | _, _ -> x.ToString()
        yield! fizzbuzz (x + 1)
    }
</pre>
