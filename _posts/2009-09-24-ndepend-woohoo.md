I finally got around and bought my private copy of [NDepend](http://www.ndepend.com/). 299€ is an ok price for this kind of software, but taxes adds this up to 400€ and my wallet feels a bit lighter. My heart is also a bit lighter and my brain is estatic.

This is a tool that let you analyze your .NET assemblies. There are several purposes for this.

* Quickly familiarize yourself with a new project.</li>
* Create nice looking code reports that none will ever read.</li>
* Know what to refactor and why.</li>

I do a lot of refactoring in my every day work. I refactor for every task I ever make, and this is quite easy when you keep it at the task level, but when you need to take a more grand approach and throw around namespaces and assemblies, you need a tool that give you that overview that will help you make your decisions.  This tool shows you where all your couplings are in your system and gives you a good idea of what you need to do.  The most fun I've had with this  tool is running it on a legacy system and just look at the mess. Right now I run it on a daily basis in a greenfield project to make sure that we continue to follow the architecture that was decided upon.  Why did I spend 400€ on this tool? Because I believe that it will help me do work that is easily worth much more than the 400€ that I spent.  Thank you [Patrick Smacchia](http://codebetter.com/blogs/patricksmacchia/) for this!
