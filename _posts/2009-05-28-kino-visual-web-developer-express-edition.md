I would like to apologize that I totally forgot about people using the Web Developer Express Edition of Visual Studio. I've updated the [download page](/kino/ "Kino") with a version of the source that is supported on this platform.  Since MsTest is not available on this platform I've migrated that source to [NUnit 2.5](http://www.nunit.org/). The code is exactly the same except for some reference changes and attribute name changes.  Also note that you need to install the [ASP.NET MVC 1.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=53289097-73ce-43bf-b6a6-35e00103cb4b&displaylang=en) project templates, before your Visual Studio will accept the web project.

Thank you!
