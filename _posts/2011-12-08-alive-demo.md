<p>I'm currently working on version 0.2 of Alive, but not announcing anything just yet. Expect an update in a couple of weeks. Until then I urge you to take a look at my <a href="http://alive.litemedia.se/Alive.axd/">live demo</a>. Open it up in your favorite Chrome browser (Firefox is ok to).</p>

<p>You have to be a bit patient with my server, because it is a very old crappy machine in my closet, I mostly use as an development environment.</p>
