<p>My family bought a computer for the first time in 1988. I was six years old, home alone with my mom and I badly wanted to play those funny games that I were playing the day before. Though, my mom did not know how to operate the computer and I was not allowed, the urge got too much and I decided to give it a try. I had seen the procedure before and I knew what to do. I had just never done it myself.  So, I flipped the power switch and waited for the screen to show  <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-444" style="margin-right: 100%;" title="Amiga kickstart ROM 1.3" src="http://litemedia.info/media/Default/Mint/amiga-kickstart-13-713246.png" alt="Amiga kickstart ROM 1.3" width="271" height="273" /> Heart was pounding in 200 bpm as I selected the disc that should play my favourite game (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Giana_Sisters">The Great Giana Sisters</a>). I inserted it into the floppy and the game started to load.</p>
<h2>Fast forward in memory...</h2>
<p>At twelve of age I sit at home during the summer on my fathers work laptop (Cyrix 586), playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_II">Doom 2</a> he lumps a thick book in my knee. <em>- It is time for you to learn how to write your own games</em>, he says, and I start the long and tedious task of learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a>.  <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-445" style="margin-right: 100%;" title="turbo_pascal" src="http://litemedia.info/media/Default/Mint/turbo_pascal.png" alt="turbo_pascal" width="540" height="383" /> After 6 months I had written a music library that used a linked list of structs for in memory handling and could both save and load the library from disc.  Debugging linked lists was something I would get back to 12 years later as I was relearning this in my university studies.</p>
<h2>Fast forward in memory...</h2>
<p>Nineteen years old I moved from my parents house to my own apartment where I spent the nights building my own <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">Linux distribution</a> and the days learning Lisp at <a href="http://www.lith.liu.se/">LiTH</a>. It was a fascinating language and the school had a fascinating nerd culture.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-446" style="margin-right: 100%;" title="Common LISP" src="http://litemedia.info/media/Default/Mint/parenmatching.png" alt="Common LISP" width="538" height="363" /> Infinite recursions made my head spin and in the evenings I would do some relaxing PHP3 coding, creating communities that were totally unmaintainable. I also had a short fling with Java, but the compiler errors made me irritated. Especially after a short course in ADA with compiler errors like 'You misspelled your method name in line 123.'</p>
<h2>Fast forward in memory...</h2>
<p>As I studied computer science at <a href="http://www.kth.se/">KTH</a> Stockholm around 2005, there was a choice to be made between Java or .NET technologies. Since all my friends and close relations were Microsoft haters, I choose .NET as a platform because I wanted to experience something new. I was astounded by the ease of getting started with C# and I felt I could be productive right away.  Today I work mainly with ASP.NET 3.5 web apps and is quite happy with that. It would be interesting working on a heavy client software application sometime, but I like the problems that web applications present. Heavy integration and scalability with thousands of users.  I feel very flexible, so who knows what technology I'll be working with tomorrow. Maybe Ruby, F# or Scala?</p>
