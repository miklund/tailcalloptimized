I held a seminar about functional programming 25 May 2011 that was video recorded. I will only speak Swedish in this video, but you can [download and read the slide notes in English from here](/assets/posts/2011-06-13-real-world-functional-programming-presentation-from-valtech-tech-days/Real%20world%20functional%20programming%20-%20Mikael%20Lundin.pdf "Real world functional programming by Mikael Lundin").
