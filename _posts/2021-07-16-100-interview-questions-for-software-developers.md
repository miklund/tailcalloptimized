This blog post is inspired by Jurgen Appelo [100 interview questions for Software Developers](https://noop.nl/2009/01/100-interview-questions-for-software-developers.html). I prefer to have a conversation instead of a knowledge test, so my questions do not have any correct answers. They should lead to conversation instead of validating knowledge.

Here we go.
