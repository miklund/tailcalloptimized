Sorry I'm balking in. I'm just a developer with strong opinions.

What are the responsibilities of a project manager? This is where my views and most of my project manager colleagues views go apart. Here are the seven sins of project managment.

A project manager should not...
-------------------------------
1. Hand out tasks to developers
2. Keep track on project budget
3. Formalizing statement of works and change requests
4. Be a barrier between the client and the team
5. Make uniformed desicions based on the team findings
6. Test the features delivered by the team
7. [PLACEHOLDER]()

### Hand out tasks to developers
This is considered a sin because it cripples the team. From being able to organize themselves and discussing who should take what task, you disrupt the internal communication and remove the discussion on how a feature should be implemented.

The result is complete breakdown of the self organized team, and the team members become dependent on the project manager to hand them new tasks. Team members that get used to being handled tasks, will expect being handled tasks and not take initiative to do tasks they've not been handled. This is not because team members are lazy, but they don't know what tasks others are working on, because the internal communication has been disrupted.

Another effect is that each tasks need a much more detailed specification when it is handed out. In a self organized team the task can be discussed when assigned and each team member can attribute with their input to the task's specification and method of implementation. With disrupted internal communication the developer that recieves the task must have a complete specification, or start the task by specifying it.

### Keep track on project budget
Estimations are not of interest as they say nothing about how much a project will cost. What they will do is keep project managers busy as they can indulge in the number counting game, where each estimated hour will be compared with work time spent. This does however not provide any value.

What does provide value is for the client to know how much money has been spent, going to be spent in the coming weeks, and how much work has been completed. This can easily be visualized by the team without a project manager
* Money spent = 'sprint' * 'number of developers' * 'days in sprint' * 'daily price'
* Work completed was demoed last sprint, and this sprint's work has been communicated to the client


### Formalizing statement of work and change requests
### Be a barrier between the client and the team
### Make uniformed desicions based on the team findings
### Test the features delivered by the team

A project manager should...
---------------------------
1. Energize and inspire the team
2. Remove impediments for the team
3. Act as the devils advocate
4. Empower communication inside and outside the team
5. Take on tasks the team cannot handle as a self organizing unit
6. Align team effort and client expectations
