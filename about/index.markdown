I created [my first blog](http://mint.litemedia.se) in 2008 when I started my
first employment in 2008. All the hip developers were having a blog, and it was
right before the general public got into blogging. I used it for taking note of
things I learned at work and documenting to myself in order to backtrack later.

A few years later in 2011 I decided to move away from Wordpress as a platform,
and I needed an excuse to try out [Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com) and
[Orchard](http://orchardproject.net). I created [litemedia.info](http://litemedia.info)
and changed focus into blogging not only for my own use, but for others. That
blog has about 100 daily visitor and my most read posts are

* [Beginners guide to Pascal](http://litemedia.info/beginners-guide-to-pascal)
* [Dependency injection with Unity and XML configuration](http://litemedia.info/part-2-dependency-injection-with-unity-and-xml-configuration)
* [Transforming an App.config file](http://litemedia.info/transforming-an-app-config-file)
* [Building composite applications in WPF](http://litemedia.info/composite-applications-in-wpf-part-1---setting-it-up)
* [Data driven test cases in NUnit](http://litemedia.info/data-driven-test-cases-in-nunit)

It is quite obvious that I have no idea when I write a post if it's going to be
of value to others, or not. It seems that my most narrow and specialized posts
are the ones that gets most page views.

I stopped blogging just about the same time as everyone else. I didn't feel I
got enough value out of it, and couldn't fit it into my routine. The blog I had
did not represent me anymore as I grew more mature in my role, I couldn't
identify myself with what I've written in 2008. That is why I choose to discontinue
[litemedia.info](http://litemedia.info) and start over.

Tail Call Optimized will be a programming blog, with its roots in functional
programming and testing. It will reflect the things I'm working on, my thoughts
of coding as a craftsmanship and crazy technology spikes.

This blog is built with the following techs and its [open sourced on github]().

* [Jekyll]()
* [Redcup Jekyll Theme](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/redcup/)
* [Amazon S3]()
* [Discus]()
