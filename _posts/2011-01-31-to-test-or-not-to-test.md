I seem to answer this question over and over.
<blockquote><em>How much effort should be put into unit testing.</em></blockquote>
And my answer is always the same.
<blockquote><em>You should write the test if the test has a higher value than the cost of writing it.</em></blockquote>
Now, this depends on the developer, how good he is at writing automatic tests. This might not be true for any of the tests of a novice unit tester. Then again, it is a investment - learning to unit test.

The novice tester would follow up with the question, "How do I know that the test will be worth more than the effort producing it?". 20% of the tests that you write will count up for 80% of the value. Just focus on the right 20%.

This rule can be made general
<blockquote><em>You should not do task X if the value of X does not exceed the effort of doing it.</em></blockquote>
