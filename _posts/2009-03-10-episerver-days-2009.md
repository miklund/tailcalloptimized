Me and Emil Birgersson held a seminar at EPiServer-days about continuous integration. It was fun, I've never held a seminar in English before, so it was a new experience.

It might be, that we didn't go deep enough into the details. We made a careful choice of keeping it simple, because we wanted all beginners to understand. We wanted customers to demand this of their consultants and we wanted to inform <em>why</em>, rather than <em>how</em>.

All questions where advanced question on <em>how</em> and that may show that we were talking to the wrong group of people. We were talking to developers that already knew why, and were much more interested in <em>how</em>, and in that - <em>advanced </em><em>how</em>.

That's a lesson learned for next time - <strong>Know your audience!</strong>
