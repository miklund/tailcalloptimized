<p>So I finally got around and bought me a <a href="http://www.fujitsu-siemens.lu/home/products/home_server/scaleo_homeserver.html">Fujitsu-Siemens Scaleo Home Server 2205</a>. It was delivered with 2x 1TB disks and since then I've plugged in another 500 GB for storage and 750 GB for backups. I've become a bit paranoid since my Lacie Big Disk failed on me.  The server looks pretty much like a suitcase and it runs real quiet. Not quiet enough for having under your desk, but sometimes when I open my closet, I wonder if it's still running.  Installation was pretty much a 1 click install that took under an hour, and it was very easy to get started with the server. Mounting a new drive took about 5 minutes and there were no need for a screwdriver. Even though I thought the price tag a bit high, I am a very pleased customer.  What will I use my home server for?</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily backups - My laptop is getting old and I don't expect it to survive the daily travels for long. <strong>When</strong> the hard drive fails, I want to be able to replace it and just keep it running until it is time to buy a new laptop.</li>
<li> Centralized storage - It is so easy just filling your computer with junk. Now I have a centralized storage facility where I can dump all the extra stuff and free some space on my working machine.</li>
<li>Source repository - I've needed a backed up repository for my source for a long time. Local file system based repository just doesn't cut it anymore. I need the safety of backups.</li>
<li>Continuous integration - I will install <a href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET">CC.NET</a> on the server to make sure that all of my source in the repository compiles and that my tests runs green.</li>
<li>Acceptance testing - I will use my server to test out Mint, just to fix "works on my machine" related bugs. Hopefully I will be able to automate deployment directly from CC.NET. We'll see how that plays out.</li>
</ul>
<p>What would you use a home server for?</p>
