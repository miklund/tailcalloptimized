So, I finally got around buying, and installing this StarCraft 2. I couldn't resist being part of the talk-the-talk at work.  Anyhow, it took me 1 week before I had enough time to push the "Start Game" button, and then I met a loop with the error message _"StarCraft II requires a patch. Would you like to download and install the patch now?"_. Very frustrating.  The reason is that there is a patch available, but the downloader does not recognize your internet/proxy settings. This is easily fixed.

1. Open up Internet Explorer. Go to Tools - > Internet Options.

2. Go to connections tab and press the button [LAN Settings]

3. Make sure that "Automatically detect settings" is **unchecked**. The problem could also be located around your Proxy server settings, if you're using a proxy server.

Enjoy the game!
