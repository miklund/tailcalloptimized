I told you about [my problems with the StarCraft II Loader](/2010/08/28/starcraft-ii-requires-a-patch-would-you-like-to-download-and-install-the-patch-now.html "StarCraft II requires a patch. Would you like to download and install the patch now?") recently. After solving that problem I didn't get very far, until I reached next one.  The game will crash pressing the connect button.

After trying all kind of things I found out that my NOD32 Antivirus software was the cause. Or rather, the problem is that the StarCraft client does not play well with antivirus. Here's [another report with Comodo Internet Security](http://eu.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/169527550#1).

## Temporarily disable NOD32 to play StarCraft II

1. Right click on the NOD32 icon in your task bar, and select Open Window.

2. Press Setup and select "Temporarily disable Antivirus and antispyware protection"

Now you should be able to connect to battle.net and play the campaign. You might think that these issues should have been taken care of during the beta testing. Anyway, I'll get back to you if I run into any more problems.
