<p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:  1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...  Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:</p>
<blockquote><strong> 1</strong>: 1 <strong> 3</strong>: 1,3 <strong> 6</strong>: 1,2,3,6 <strong>10</strong>: 1,2,5,10 <strong>15</strong>: 1,3,5,15 <strong>21</strong>: 1,3,7,21 <strong>28</strong>: 1,2,4,7,14,28</blockquote>
<p>We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.  What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>
<pre class="brush:fsharp">let rec triangle_number order =
    if order = 0 then order else order + triangle_number (order - 1)

let rec get_divisors n (i:int) (divisors:list<int>) =
    if i < (n / 2) then
        if (n % i) = 0 then
            get_divisors n (i + 1) (i :: divisors)
        else
            get_divisors n (i + 1) divisors
    else
        divisors

let rec find_triangle_number order number_of_divisors =
    let divisors = (get_divisors (triangle_number order) 1 []).Length
    if divisors > number_of_divisors then
        order
    else
        find_triangle_number (order + 1) number_of_divisors
