Today I'm having two talks at <a href="http://www.valtech.se/valtechdays/">Valtech .NET Days</a>.
<h2>Testability in ASP.NET MVC</h2>
My talk about ASP.NET MVC focuses on how to create applications that have testability in focus. While the presentation is in Swedish, my code examples should be readable for developer of any nation. :)

<h2>Code Contracts</h2>
My talk will focus on the new functionality in .NET 4 called Code Contracts. Where does it come from and why is it here? Though my presentation is in Swedish my code samples should be of value to anyone.
