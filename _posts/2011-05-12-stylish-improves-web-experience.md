<p>I hate advertisement. I would never ever dream about putting advertisement on this blog. I hate it with all my soul, so much that I pay extra for some services just to get rid of the advertisement. I don't look at commercial TV and I get bored at podradios pausing for a message from sponsors. Ye, I guess that you need sponsors because it is expensive to host a podcast, but I would rather pay 3$ per show just to not listen to your intro, outro or sponsor messages. Pure content - that's the melody!</p>
<h2>Banner advertisment</h2>
<p>The Internet is full of these banners that tries to steal focus from the content. I've been a fan of <a href="http://www.chromeadblock.com">Adblock</a> for years, and I also use <a href="http://www.chromeextensions.org/appearance-functioning/flashblock/">Flashblock</a> on all my computers. Adblock uses some specialized logic that block ads from known advertisement sources. Flashblock blocks all flash running in the browser.  In Flashblock you have a white list of sites that you want to support flash on, for example <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> or <a href="http://www.infoq.com">InfoQ</a>. All other flash will display a play icon instead, where you can select to make an exception for this site.</p>

<p>This is great if you're a tab-user like me that easily open up 30-40 tabs every day in my browser. If each would have a flash that would steal CPU, my computer would be doomed.</p>
<h2>Style the web with stylish</h2>
<p>To take this a step further, there really are some sites that look horrible, because they manage to get advertisement beyond both Adblock and flashblock. What can we do about them?  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe">Stylish </a>is a Chrome plugin that lets you redecorate a plugin by rewriting the css. This gives you full control over the presentation layer on the web.</p>

<p>The cool thing is the gallery where you can download predefined styles created by the community. This way you don't have to restyle the whole web by yourself. :)  Here's what a swedish newspaper looks without stylish.</p>

<p>And this is what it looks like after custom styling.</p>

<p>It's like you're able to breathe again!  Now, go <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe">get stylish</a> from the Google Web Store.</p>
